    "- It first asks for the user to input its age, and retrieves the info from the user.\n",

    "- If the age given by the user is larger than 122 (oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment[1]), then the print should display \"I really doubt you are ___ years old...\" with the blank filled accordingly.\n",
