# # Activity 1 - Ask for the user's age

# ### Tasks
# 
# Write a function **ask_user_age()**, as described below.
# - It receives no parameters and returns no parameters.
# - It first asks for the user to input its age, and retrieves the info from the user.
# - If the age is negative (0 included), the function should print a message that reads "Your age cannot be negative, it must be at least 1."
# - If the age given by the user is larger than 122 (oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment[1]), then the print should display "I really doubt you are ___ years old..." with the blank filled accordingly.
# - Otherwise, the function should print "Oh, you are ___ years old? That's cool!", with the blank filled accordingly.
# 
# Do not forget to test your function, on all three possible cases, to verify it works.
