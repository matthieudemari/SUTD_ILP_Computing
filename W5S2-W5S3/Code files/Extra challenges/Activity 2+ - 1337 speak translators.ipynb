    "**Leet (or \"1337\")**, also known as eleet or leetspeak, is a system of modified spellings used primarily on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "It often uses character replacements in ways that play on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, leet speak replaces:\n",
    "- the letters I, with 1,\n",
    "- the letters Z, with 2,\n",
    "- the letters E, with 3,\n",
    "- the letters A, with 4,\n",
    "- the letters S, with 5,\n",
    "- the letters T, with 7,\n",
    "- the letters B, with 8,\n",
    "- the letters O, with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the English sentence **\"HELLO THERE, HOW ARE YOU?\"** will write in leet speak as **\"H3LL0 7H3R3, H0W 4R3 Y0U?\"**."
