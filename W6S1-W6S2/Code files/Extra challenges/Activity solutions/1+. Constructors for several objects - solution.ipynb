    "- **board**, which denotes the current state of the board, and is defined as a list of 3 lists of 3 elements, full of zeroes, when the board is created.\n",
    "- **is_full**, defined as a Boolean, whose initial value is False. It is set to True if the board is full and no moves are left to play.\n",
    "- **has_winner**, defined as a Boolean, whose initial value is False. It will later be set to True if the board has a clear winner.\n",
    "- **winner**, whose value will later be set to 1, if the player 1 (circles) has won, and 2 if the player 2 (crosses) has won. When the board is initialized, it is set to None.\n",
