    "We can define any card in a deck, by using two integers.\n",
    "- The first integer **suit_integer** takes the following values: 1 (for hearts), 2 (for diamonds), 3 (for spades), 4 (for clubs).\n",
    "- The second integer **value_integer** takes the following values: 1 (for ace), 2 (for 2), 3 (for 3), ..., 10 (for 10), 11 (for jack), 12 (for queen), 13 (for king).\n",

    "- The first card, defined with the variables **hidden_suit and hidden_value**, corresponds to the card that the user/player must guess. (This is something we would normally hide from the player, but let us pretend for now!)\n",
    "- The second card, defined with the variables **guessed_suit and guessed_value**, corresponds to the card guessed by the user, and these values must be acquired via input()."
