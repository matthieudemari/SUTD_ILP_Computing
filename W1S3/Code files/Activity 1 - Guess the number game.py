# # Activity 1 - Guess the number game

# ### Tasks
# 
# Let us consider two integers
# - The first one, **true_number**, corresponds to a number that the user/player should guess. This is something we would normally hide from the player, but let us pretend for now!
# - The second one, **guessed_number**, corresponds to the number guessed by the user, and is acquired via input().
# 
# Both numbers will take values between 0 and 9, for simplicity.
# 
# Write some code, so that Python acquires a number from the user using input, and prints the following statements with appropriate True/False boolean values printed in the blanks.
# - "You have guessed the true number: ______"
# - "The true number is higher than your guess:  ______"
# - "The true number is lower than your guess: ______"

# ### Your code below!

# In[ ]:


# 1. Let us choose a number to guess (for instance, 6)
# Feel free to change it to a different value if you want!
true_number = 6


# In[ ]:


# 2. Ask for user to guesss the number, acquire it by using input()
# Remember to convert the string variable, you obtained from input(),
# to an int variable before performing boolean operations!
# Your turn to code below!
guessed_number = None


# In[ ]:


# 3. Check if the user guessed the right number
# Your turn to code below!
print(None)

# 4. Check if the guessed_number is striclty lower than the true_number
# Your turn to code below!
print(None)

# 5. Check if the guessed_number is striclty higher than the true_number
# Your turn to code below!
print(None)
