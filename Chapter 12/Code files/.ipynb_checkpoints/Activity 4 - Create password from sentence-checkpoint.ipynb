    "\n",
    "From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase\n",
    "\n",
    "A **passphrase** is a sentence which can be used to create passwords that are difficult to crack and easy to memorize.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user simply needs to create a memorable sentence containing multiple words. Later on, the user will assemble a password by alternating the first letter of each word in the passphrase and the number of characters in it. In addition, add the special characters when they appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the sentence \"I used to be an adventurer like you until I took an arrow to the knee\" can be used to generate the following password \"I1u4t2b2a2a10l4y3u5I1t4a2a5t2t3k4\""
